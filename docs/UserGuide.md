## ⚠️ Current HRelper Prototype Overview
The current version of the HRelper is a prototype designed to showcase its core functionality.

* At present, the prototype is tailored to Singapore, meaning that phone numbers and NRICs are configured for Singapore-based operations.
* Since this is just a prototype of how our HRelper works, in real world scenarios, we will customise the valid department list according to the company's needs. Each company should populate the valid department before using HRelper.
* Attributes marked with an asterisk (*) indicate that they are in their current form because they follow the structure of the prototype.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F14-2/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for HRelper.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar [CS2103-F14-02][HRelper].jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/UI.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts with full attributes.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com ic/T0312345A g/Male d/02-Jan-2001 j/15-Apr-2025 nat/Singaporean a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25/119278 t/Finance/Full-Time/Financial Analyst` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `view Lee` : Views the contact by their surname.

   * `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower`: Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower`.

   * `findByDepartment Finance` : Lists all contacts in this specific department

   * `note`: Adds optional remarks to people in their address book and edit it if required.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Words in `SQUARE BRACKETS [ ]` are optional parameters. <br>
  e.g. in `edit 1 [n/NAME]`, `NAME` is an optional parameter

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</div>

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaning how to access the help page.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`


### Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the address book.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL ic/NRIC g/GENDER d/DOB j/DATE OF JOINING nat/NATIONALITY a/ADDRESS/POSTAL CODE t/DEPARTMENT/EMPLOYMENTTYPE/JOBTITLE`

* Names are case-insensitive. The profile will automatically capitalise the first letter of each word and convert all other letters to lowercase.
* Phone numbers must be exactly 8 digits long and start with 6, 8, or 9.*
* NRIC should start with S, T, F, or G, followed by 7 digits, and end with a capital letter.*
* Gender is case-insensitive but will only take in Male, Female or Other.*

  **Single-digit days and months must be zero-padded (e.g., use 01 instead of 1)**
* DOB must be a valid date that is not in the future.
* Date of Joining must be a valid date that is after DOB. Future dates are allowed to account for upcoming hires. (If the contract date is yet to be confirmed, please select the first day of the joining month.)
* Nationality is case-insensitive but follows a pre-defined set of common nationalities. In the rare case where a nationality is not specified, choose 'Other'.
* Address follows postal codes (specifically, the Postal Sector) defined by the [Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/-/media/Corporate/Property/PMI-Online/List_Of_Postal_Districts.pdf).
* Tag fields (i.e. Department, Employment Type, Job Title) are case-insensitive. Additionally, certain short forms are valid for Department.

**To note: Each person is unique based on their NRIC**


Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com ic/T0312345A g/Male d/02-Jan-2001 j/15-Apr-2025 nat/Singaporean a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25/119278 t/Finance/Full-Time/Financial Analyst`

### Saving the data

HRelper data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

HRelper data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/hrelper.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, HRelper will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

### <a id="q1"></a>Q1: What happens if I close the app? Will my data be lost?
**A**: No worries! HRelper automatically saves all your data after every change. When you reopen the app, your latest data will still be there.

### <a id="q2"></a>Q2: Can I search for employees by job title or department?<br>
**A**: Yes! Use commands like `findByDepartment`, `findByJobTitle`, or `findByEmploymentType`.
Example: `findByDepartment Marketing` will show all employees in the Marketing department.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. HRelper currently does not validate whether email addresses are real, allowing users to input non-existent or invalid emails.
4. HRelper does not currently verify the authenticity of user-provided addresses, which may result in the submission of inaccurate or non-existent locations.
